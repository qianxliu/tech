TYPE: 

It gave me the really dark shadows in many times(will not explain details because it must be a lot pains). I once worked with some "python"(see the bottom) developers which spoke the pure analytical language, which means they usually have a habit, i.e. ignored the context.(especially these people are in the high position with the endless powers)
The story is also being like: a "var" goes this, that function executes a (highly abstract noun). TYPE is just important because somehow we need to determine something. **It's not any philosophical implication**.
Just because the exact meanings of a concept can eliminate the ugliness of the gods. We need to know the truth and exact event just like a camera, so we should not be confused by bubble reputations or others.

(void *)?
The genericity(It still has a type), are just often made by sages. For a function/lambada's return values(void*, auto), it must have an abstraction to accomplish the limited of common programmers. Not every programmers can write a thread without any thread libraries.

But I just used the (void *) in this place, because it's the need of the thread libraries.
TYPE is the abstraction. We just need to measure myself's abilities/moralities for the genericity.

Such as if we talked about the results of biology, we must be careful to evaulate it from a generical perspective(such as social science). Especially we should not based on the false biology.
So we just pass the generical ideas to the true biology.
